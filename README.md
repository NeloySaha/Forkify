An app where, the users can search for recipes for any popular food. The selected recipes are displayed in the dashboard. Besides that, users can customize the servings and get their personalized ingredients amount for that particular recipe. They can bookmark the their recipes which will persist throughout the page reloads. They can also add their own recipes here.
